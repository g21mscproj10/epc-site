# frontend-stack-demo
quick little demo of proposed FE stack in case anyone wants to see what the barebones structure will probably look like when we get started.

## To run:

### 1. Make sure you have Nodejs and npm installed
[See here for instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
### 2. Clone the repo
### 3. Run this command inside the main project directory to install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
### 4. Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```
The project will now be viewable in the browser at localhost:3000
