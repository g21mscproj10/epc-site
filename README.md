GreenHouse is a full-stack web application that expands on an existing U.K.government website https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate
which displays Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) for U.K. homes. 

The site shows data on individual houses, aggregate statistics on the efficiency of nearby households, as well as supporting
crowdsourced data collection for improvement recommendations.

*Including beta implementation of Google BigQuery for data warehousing and analysis*
